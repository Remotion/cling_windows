Cling - The Interactive C++ Interpreter
=========================================

[Cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling).exe build for Windows.

Overview
--------
Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM compiler
infrastructure. Cling realizes the [read-eval-print loop
(REPL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as a
small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths such
as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.
